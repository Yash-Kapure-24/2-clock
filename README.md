# React + Vite Clock Project ‚è∞

About the Project
This project is a sleek, responsive clock application built using React.js. It dynamically displays the current time with real-time updates and showcases the power of React's component-based architecture and state management.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
